HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Analysis

About This Project

In this project, I analyzed an HR employee dataset to understand why employees leave the company (Attrition).

The main goal was to find:
- Which department has high attrition
- Why employees leave
- Which employees are at risk
- How salary, overtime, and experience affect attrition

I used Python, SQL, and Power BI to perform complete end-to-end analysis.

Python Work (Data Analysis)

In Python, I:

- Loaded and cleaned the data
- Removed useless columns
- Checked missing values
- Performed exploratory data analysis
- Compared features with Attrition
- Created charts and visualizations

SQL Work

Using SQL, I solved business problems like:

- Attrition rate by department
- Average salary by job role
- Top paid employees
- Employees earning more than department average
- Ranking employees using window functions
- Experience vs attrition analysis

I used:
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- Subqueries
- Window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LAG)

Power BI Dashboard

I built interactive dashboards to show insights visually.

### Dashboard includes:
- Total Employees, Attrition, Attrition Rate
- Attrition by Department
- Attrition by Job Role
- Salary analysis
- Gender and marital status analysis
- Department-wise joiners vs attrition chart

The dashboard helps HR quickly identify high-risk areas.
